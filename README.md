# Resume
This is my Résumé website

For now there isn't much to show off since I'm just starting my carreer as web developer, so it looks a bit empty.

Code-wise I added just a couple of functions mostly for fun.
There is a function that calculates my age based on the current year, so it stays always updated.
Then there are buttons that translate the whole page to English or Italian so the user can read in their preferred language.
For now it defaults to English, and the user has to manually change the language by clicking the button, but I plan to add automatic detection based on location of the user so it gives them the page of their language.
