# Resume
This is my Résumé website

For now it's a bit empty since I'm just starting my carreer as web developer and I haven't worked on any big projects yet.

There are buttons that translate the whole page to English or Italian so the user can read in their preferred language. The page defaults to English but if it detects that the browser's language is Italian, it will automatically translate the page.

There is a button for each skill that shows the description of the skill when clicked.
