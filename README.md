# Resume
This is my Résumé website:

There are buttons that translate the whole page to English or Italian so the user can read in their preferred language. The page defaults to English but if it detects that the browser's language is Italian, it will automatically translate the page.

There is a button for each skill that shows a brief description when clicked.
